# Welcome to Spoonjoy's Component Kitchen

You found it. The secret sauce. The mise en place of our UI. Welcome to Storybook, where components come to be poked, prodded, and occasionally yelled at until they work correctly.

Think of this as the test kitchen for Spoonjoy's interface—a place where buttons get clicked thousands of times, inputs receive the strangest possible values, and someone inevitably asks "but what if the user types 47 emojis?"

## Getting This Thing Running

```bash
npm run storybook
```

That's it. No arcane incantations required. It'll spin up on `localhost:6006` and you can click around to your heart's content.

If you're feeling fancy and want to build a static version (for deployment, showing off, or just proving you can):

```bash
npm run build-storybook
```

## What's in Here

We've got components. Lots of components. Organized with the care of someone who has opinions about folder structure.

### Form Inputs
The workhorses of data collection. Type things, click things, select things.

- **[Button](/docs/ui-button--docs)** — 21 color variants. Because we couldn't pick just one.
- **[Input](/docs/ui-input--docs)** — For when you need users to type things.
- **[Textarea](/docs/ui-textarea--docs)** — Like Input, but for people who have a lot to say.
- **[Checkbox](/docs/ui-checkbox--docs)** — Binary decisions made visual.
- **[Radio](/docs/ui-radio--docs)** — When checkbox said "pick one."
- **[Switch](/docs/ui-switch--docs)** — Toggle things on. Toggle things off. Revolutionary.
- **[Select](/docs/ui-select--docs)** — Native dropdowns for the purists.
- **[Listbox](/docs/ui-listbox--docs)** — Custom dropdowns for the fancy folks.
- **[Combobox](/docs/ui-combobox--docs)** — Type-to-filter because scrolling is for suckers.

### Typography & Display
Making words look good since... well, since we built this.

- **[Heading](/docs/ui-heading--docs)** — h1 through h6, semantically correct and everything.
- **[Text](/docs/ui-text--docs)** — Paragraphs, but make them configurable.
- **[Badge](/docs/ui-badge--docs)** — Little colored pills of information.
- **[Avatar](/docs/ui-avatar--docs)** — Circles with faces (or initials, we don't judge).
- **[Link](/docs/ui-link--docs)** — Underlined text that takes you places.
- **[Divider](/docs/ui-divider--docs)** — A horizontal line. Surprisingly useful.

### Feedback & Overlays
When you need the user's attention RIGHT NOW.

- **[Alert](/docs/ui-alert--docs)** — Modal dialogs that demand acknowledgment.
- **[Dialog](/docs/ui-dialog--docs)** — Modals for when you need more than buttons.
- **[Dropdown](/docs/ui-dropdown--docs)** — Menus that appear when summoned.
- **[ValidationError](/docs/ui-validationerror--docs)** — Red text that tells you what you did wrong.

### Data Display
Showing users their stuff in organized ways.

- **[Table](/docs/ui-table--docs)** — Rows and columns of data, as nature intended.
- **[DescriptionList](/docs/ui-descriptionlist--docs)** — Key-value pairs, but pretty.
- **[Pagination](/docs/ui-pagination--docs)** — Navigate through pages of content.

### Layout
The bones that hold everything together.

- **[Fieldset](/docs/ui-fieldset--docs)** — Group form fields with labels.
- **[StackedLayout](/docs/ui-stackedlayout--docs)** — Stacked page layout structure.
- **[SidebarLayout](/docs/ui-sidebarlayout--docs)** — When you need a sidebar. Shocking.
- **[Navbar](/docs/ui-navbar--docs)** — Navigation at the top.
- **[Sidebar](/docs/ui-sidebar--docs)** — Navigation on the side.

### Auth & App-Specific
The Spoonjoy specials.

- **[AuthLayout](/docs/auth-authlayout--docs)** — Wrapper for login/signup pages.
- **[OAuth](/docs/auth-oauth--docs)** — Social login buttons that actually work.
- **[StepOutputUseDisplay](/docs/recipe-stepoutputusedisplay--docs)** — Recipe step magic.

## How to Actually Use This

1. **Browse the sidebar** — Components are organized by category. Click around.
2. **Check the Docs tab** — Each component has documentation explaining what it does and why.
3. **Play with Controls** — The controls panel lets you tweak props in real-time. It's like a DJ mixer but for UI.
4. **Run the interactions** — Some stories have automated tests. Watch robots click buttons for you.
5. **Test accessibility** — The a11y tab shows accessibility violations. Fix them. Please.

## The Philosophy

Every component in here follows a few guiding principles:

- **HeadlessUI for behavior** — We don't reinvent focus traps or keyboard navigation.
- **Tailwind for styling** — Utility classes all the way down.
- **Dark mode support** — Because some of us code at 2am.
- **Accessibility first** — Screen readers are users too.
- **Snarky documentation** — If we have to write docs, we're at least going to have fun.

## Pro Tips

- **Use the search** — Press `/` or click the search icon. Finding things is faster than scrolling.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Press `?` to see all the shortcuts. You're welcome.
- **Zoom with your browser** — Components are shown at actual size. Zoom if you need to squint.
- **Dark mode toggle** — There's a sun/moon icon in the toolbar. Use it.
