## TDD Workflow

### Phase 1: Spec (Test Suite)

Write the full test suite FIRST. This is your contract/specification.

**Files to create/modify:**
- [ ] `test/[path]/[feature].test.ts`

**Test coverage requirements:**
- [ ] Happy path scenarios
- [ ] Edge cases
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Input validation

**Run tests (must FAIL):**
```bash
npm test -- --run [test-file-pattern]
```

Expected: All new tests fail (no implementation yet)

---

### Phase 2: Implementation

Only begin after spec is complete and tests fail as expected.

**Files to create/modify:**
- [ ] [list implementation files]

**Implementation checklist:**
- [ ] [atomic work item 1]
- [ ] [atomic work item 2]
- [ ] ...

**Constraints:**
- Do NOT modify tests during implementation
- If tests seem wrong, pause and discuss

---

### Phase 3: Verification

**Run full test suite:**
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] All new tests pass
- [ ] No regressions in existing tests
- [ ] Coverage meets threshold (statements: 95%+, branches: 85%+)
- [ ] No new warnings (eslint, type errors)
