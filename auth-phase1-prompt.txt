Complete the authentication system for this React Router v7 + Cloudflare app.

Current state:
- Login and signup routes exist but need to be completed and wired up
- Auth library files exist (auth.server.ts, session.server.ts)
- Using bcryptjs for password hashing
- Prisma User model supports both password and OAuth

Tasks:
1. Review and complete the auth library files (auth.server.ts, session.server.ts)
2. Complete the login and signup route implementations  
3. Add routes to routes.ts configuration
4. Create a logout route
5. Add protected route middleware/logic
6. Create a simple dashboard/recipes route that requires authentication
7. Update home.tsx to show login/signup links when not authenticated
8. Test the full auth flow works

Technical requirements:
- Use React Router v7 patterns (loaders, actions, forms)
- Follow server-side session pattern (not JWT)
- Keep it simple but secure
- Add proper error handling and validation
- Use TypeScript properly

When completely finished, run:
clawdbot gateway wake --text "✅ Phase 1: Auth system complete" --mode now
