## Items

### 1. Mobile header not responsive
- **Issue**: Header shows all items inline, breaks on mobile (Login + Sign Up buttons overflow)
- **Screenshot**: Header cramped, "Sign Up" button cut off on right edge
- **Fix**: Show mobile nav (hamburger menu) even when logged out
- **Note**: Can simplify mobile nav for unauthenticated users

### 2. Seeding doesn't work with D1
- **Issue**: `npm run db:seed` writes to SQLite, but app reads from D1
- **Impact**: Guide removed seeding instructions, but users want demo data + test creds
- **Fix needed**: Either:
  - Create SQL seed file for D1: `npx wrangler d1 execute spoonjoy-local --local --file=./migrations/seed.sql`
  - Or modify seed script to work with D1
- **Must include**: Demo user with known credentials (e.g., `demo@spoonjoy.com` / `demo1234`)
- **Status**: Claude Code working on this now

### 3. Dark mode not working on empty states
- **Issue**: "No recipes yet" text is white/light gray on light gray background — nearly invisible
- **Screenshot**: Empty recipes page, text unreadable
- **Fix**: Text color needs dark mode variant (e.g., `text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300`)

### 4. "Create Recipe" button broken
- **Issue**: Button doesn't work (likely route/action not implemented)
- **Impact**: Guide walks through creating recipes but the feature isn't complete
- **Fix**: Either implement the route or update guide to reflect current state
